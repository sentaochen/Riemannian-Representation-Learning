# Riemannian Representation Learning (RRL)

This repository contains a paper with supplementary material for the deep domain adaptation approach DNA, and a pytorch implementation of the DNA approach.

In a nutshell, DNA solves the joint distribution mismatch problem in deep domain adaptation for large scale image recognition. To this end, it exploits a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to match the source and target joint distributions in the network representation space under the Relative Chi-Square (RCS) divergence. The following figure illustrates this deep joint distribution matching idea.   


This repository provides the Pytorch code for the work "Domain Generalization by Joint-Product Distribution Alignment" published in Pattern Recognition, 2022. In this work, we study the non-identically distributed supervised learning problem, where the training data are sampled from multiple different (probabilityï¼‰distributions, while the test data are governed by another different yet related distribution. We design a Joint-Product Distribution Alignment (JPDA) approach that aligns a joint distribution and a product distribution to tackle the distribution difference (see the illustration below), with (1) the loss function being the Relative Chi-Square (RCS) divergence, (2) the hypothesis space being the neural network transformation, and (3) the learning algorithm being the minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent (minibatch SGD).
